# aTello 
Work In Progress cross platform Ryze/DJI Tello control library. Currently supports Android and PC.  
Right now Android only has a bare bones UI and NO live video support. Currently NO onscreen joysticks. So it Requires a PS3 Joystick connected via OTG cable for a controller. 
PC is just a simple console app.
